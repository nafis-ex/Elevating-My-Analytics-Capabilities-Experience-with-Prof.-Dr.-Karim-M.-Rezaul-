I am grateful to Prof. Dr. Karim M. Rezaul for an insightful and value-driven three-day training on Business Data Analytics organized by EduLinking Career, where I had the opportunity to enhance my practical skills in Power BI and Tableau. The sessions were rich in real-world applications, helping me strengthen my understanding of data visualization, dashboard storytelling, and decision-focused analytics. As part of the hands-on projects, I developed a Power BI Sales Dashboard showcasing monthly revenue trends, key performance metrics, and state-level sales distribution, and a Tableau Sales Summary Dashboard featuring product category analysis, quarterly sales performance, and shipping mode insights. This experience has further enriched my analytical toolkit, and I look forward to applying these learnings in my professional journey. 😊
